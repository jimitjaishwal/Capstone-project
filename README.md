## Project: Capstone Proposal and Capstone Project - Udacity MLND(Find the nuclei in divergent images to advance medical discovery)

**Note**

The Capstone is a two-staged project. The first is the proposal component, where you can receive valuable feedback about your project idea, design, and proposed solution. This must be completed prior to your implementation and submitting for the capstone project. 

1.Following are the file descriptions and URL’s from which the data can be obtained :

```
• train.zip - training set images (images and annotated masks) [Download](https://www.kaggle.com/c/8089/download/stage1_train.zip)
• test.zip - stage 1 test set images (images only, you are predicting the masks) [Download](https://www.kaggle.com/c/8089/download/stage1_test.zip)

```

**Note**

I provide already download code in notebook the i rename those files as train.zip and test.zip the actual file name of data is stage1_train.zip and stage1_test.zip if you danload dataset in hear so the folder name is  stage1_train.zip and stage1_test.zip

2.Following are the details of Software environments with version details :

```
• Python 3.6.0 :: Anaconda 4.3.1 (64-bit)
• Tensorflow 1.1.0
• Keras 2.0.4
• tqdm 3.7.1
• png - curl -LO https://raw.github.com/drj11/pypng/master/code/png.py

```
